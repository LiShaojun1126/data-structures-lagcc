    // With the help of one stack only, reorganize the content of the original stack
    //so that all negative numbers go to the bottom and all positive numbers on the top of the stack,
    //order does not matter. Use as many loops as you can

        first loop you will pop all numbers out,
        pop -4, negative, so keep it in a variable lastNegative = -4

        pop 4 push it to helpStack, = [4]
        pop -3, negative, is lastNegative < 0, push lastNegative into help: help[4, -4]
